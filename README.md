# Computer Systems - Search Puzzle Solver (2019 - 2020)

<b>Course Name:</b> Informatics 2C - Introduction to Computer Systems
<br><b>Coursework Name:</b> MIPS Assembly Language Programming
<br><b>Programming Language(s):</b> MIPS & C
<br><b>Final Mark:</b> 96%
<br><b>Overall Course Mark:</b> 87%

The aim of the coursework is to solve a search puzzle in different directions using MIPS and C.

Given a text file which contains the words to look for, dictionary.txt, we must check if they are in the puzzle either horizontally, vertically or diagonally (including wraparound). If any word has been found, it should be printed in the following format: <em>line number, word</em>.

As it can be seen in the uploaded files, there is a 1D-grid and a 2D-grid which represent the puzzles. Obviously, it is possible to change the words to look for (in dictionary.txt) and the puzzles to try any other different mix of characters and words.

## Getting Started

These subsections will help you get a copy of the project and understand how to run it on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
I will discuss how to clone this repository and set it up in any IDE of your choice. Furthermore, instructions on how to run the server will be given as well as how to build & run the project from the terminal.

### How to Install

The first thing you should do is clone this repository into your local machine. You can do this with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Paramiru/Search-Puzzle-Solver
```
Once you have cloned the repository, you can import the project to your preferred IDE. I used MARS IDE and its .jar file is included in the repo, but feel free to use whichever you are most comfortable with (VS Code, for example).
